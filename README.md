LibreICONS is a Free (as in Cost, and Liberty) Icon Library in much of a similar spirit as Font Awesome, Glyphicons, and other great Icons Libraries available.

Why another Icon Library? Well, out of much frustration of other Icon Libraries either having Icons that were needed for Web Development, from watching posts in other Projects for requested Icons, and those requests not being fullfiled or simply ignored. And due to the similar needs of missing Icons from other Libraries for developing [LibreCMS](https://github.com/StudioJunkyard/LibreCMS).

We'll try to include the most requested Icons that aren't, won't, or just taking way to long to be implemented in other Icon Packages, while excluding those that are plainly not needed.

The included icons are sized to fit within 14 x 14.

Icons are originally designed or converted in SVG Format.

Here's a breakdown, of what were working on getting done thus far:

CSS Helpers:
============
Colors
Sizing
Rotation
Flipping
Animation
Stacking

Class names for other Font Libraries are also included to make transitioning easier from another Library, so there's no actual need to sift through code and change class names.
