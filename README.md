LibreICONS is a Free (as in Cost, and Liberty) Icon Library in much of a similar spirit as Font Awesome, Glyphicons, and other great Icons Libraries available.

Why another Icon Library? Well, out of much frustration of other Icon Libraries either having Icons that were needed for Web Development, from watching posts in other Projects for requested Icons, and those requests not being fullfiled or simply ignored. And due to the similar needs of missing Icons from other Libraries for developing LibreCMS.

We'll try to include the most requested Icons that aren't, won't, or just taking way to long to be implemented in other Icon Packages, while excluding those that are plainly not needed.

That being said, we have at the moment, Zero Icons.

We'll be designing Icons in SVG Format first in Monochrome (Black and White), and Colour, then converting them to other formats. So you may find the SVG Icons have many more as we convert them over.

Here's a breakdown, of what were working on getting done thus far:
