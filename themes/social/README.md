### LibreICONS Social Icons

This is a Social Icon Set, using the SVG File Icons from LibreICONS.

If your already using the LibreICONS SVG File version of the the Library, then you need only add the CSS File, or append it into the the Icon Frameworks main CSS.

We use the Icons in LibreCMS by using a PHP function to include the file into Pages to embed the SVG directly into the DOM, which allows us to dynamically change colours, sizes, and so on. Which BTW, is also how GitHub uses their SVG Icons.

In your markup use: `<a class="libre-social">[function or reference to add SVG File]</i>`
You can also use `s32` or `s64` after the `libre-social` class to change the icon sizing to 32px or 64px.

Pretty simple right?
